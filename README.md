# deep-learning-films-genre
As part of a deep learning course project, we decide to use neural network to predict film genre from its poster

## Procedure
First if you don't get the posters, run : `dataset_preparation.py`
It will load all images but will take a long time (depending on your internet connection)
Then, to do data augmentation, run : `image_processing.py`

If you want to delete all processed images, run 'remove_processed_images.py`
